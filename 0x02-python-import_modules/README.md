# import and modules 
- A moule is a file containing the definitions and functions of stuff.
- The import statement combines two operations; it searches for the named module, then it binds the results of that search to a name in the local scope.

## Example
> from fibo import * - means we import everything from fibo
> package A.B - means B is a submodue of A
